Automatic Panorama Stitcher
===========================

This project implements a pipeline for the automatic warping of images into panoramic compositions via planar reprojection based on feature matching. The project is based on the work by `Brown, Szeliski and Winder <https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa18/Papers/MOPS.pdf>`_, as well as lectures from `UC Berkeleyâ€™s CS194-26: Image Manipulation and Computational Photography <https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa18/>`_.

For a detailed writeup on the project see `this post <https://0xfede.io/2019/03/09/panorama.html>`_.

Dependencies:
=============
* `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_
* `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ (for Harris corner detector)
